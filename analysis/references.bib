We conducted a controlled, preregistered study using parallel-projected 3D pie charts. Angle, area, and arc length differ dramatically when projected and change over a large range of values. Modeling these changes and comparing them to study participants' estimates allows us to rank the different visual cues by model fit. Area emerges as the most likely cue used to read pie charts.},

  abstract = {One of the fundamental tasks in visualization is to compare two or more visual elements. However, it is often difficult to visually differentiate graphical elements encoding a small difference in value, such as the heights of similar bars in bar chart or angles of similar sections in pie chart. Perceptual laws can be used in order to model when and how we perceive this difference. In this work, we model the perception of Just Noticeable Differences (JNDs), the minimum difference in visual attributes that allow faithfully comparing similar elements, in charts. Specifically, we explore the relation between JNDs and two major visual variables: the intensity of visual elements and the distance between them, and study it in three charts: bar chart, pie chart and bubble chart. Through an empirical study, we identify main effects on JND for distance in bar charts, intensity in pie charts, and both distance and intensity in bubble charts. By fitting a linear mixed effects model, we model JND and find that JND grows as the exponential function of variables. We highlight several usage scenarios that make use of the JND modeling in which elements below the fitted JND are detected and enhanced with secondary visual cues for better discrimination.},

  abstract = {All-pairwise comparisons among a set of t treatments or groups are one of the most frequent tasks in applied statistics. Users of statistical software are accustomed to the familiar lines display, in which treatments that do not differ significantly, are connected by a common line or letter. Availability of the lines display is restricted mainly to the balanced analysis of variance setup. This limited availability is at stark variance with the diversity of statistical methods and models, which call for multiple comparisons. This article describes a general method for graphically representing any set of t(t-1)/2 all-pairwise significance statements (p values) for t treatments by a familiar letter display, which is applicable regardless of the underlying data structure or the statistical method used for comparisons. The method reproduces the familiar lines display in case of the balanced analysis of variance. Its broad applicability is demonstrated using data from an international multienvironment wheat yield trial and from a fish catching survey.},

  abstract = {Bar charts are one of the most common visualization types. In a classic graphical perception paper, Cleveland \& McGill studied how different bar chart designs impact the accuracy with which viewers can complete simple perceptual tasks. They found that people perform substantially worse on stacked bar charts than on aligned bar charts, and that comparisons between adjacent bars are more accurate than between widely separated bars. However, the study did not explore why these differences occur. In this paper, we describe a series of follow-up experiments to further explore and explain their results. While our results generally confirm Cleveland \& McGill's ranking of various bar chart configurations, we provide additional insight into the bar chart reading task and the sources of participants' errors. We use our results to propose new hypotheses on the perception of bar charts.},

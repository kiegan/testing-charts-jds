Explains how to design and execute valid samples of moderate dimensions and difficulty, avoid selection biases and how to become more adept at evaluating sample results, judge their validity and limits of inference, applicability and precision. Contains numerous practical procedures, the domestic arts of sampling along with its science plus invaluable tricks that are usually learned only in apprenticeship.},

We conducted a controlled, preregistered study using parallel-projected 3D pie charts. Angle, area, and arc length differ dramatically when projected and change over a large range of values. Modeling these changes and comparing them to study participants' estimates allows us to rank the different visual cues by model fit. Area emerges as the most likely cue used to read pie charts.},

  abstract = {Bar charts are one of the most common visualization types. In a classic graphical perception paper, Cleveland \& McGill studied how different bar chart designs impact the accuracy with which viewers can complete simple perceptual tasks. They found that people perform substantially worse on stacked bar charts than on aligned bar charts, and that comparisons between adjacent bars are more accurate than between widely separated bars. However, the study did not explore why these differences occur. In this paper, we describe a series of follow-up experiments to further explore and explain their results. While our results generally confirm Cleveland \& McGill's ranking of various bar chart configurations, we provide additional insight into the bar chart reading task and the sources of participants' errors. We use our results to propose new hypotheses on the perception of bar charts.},
